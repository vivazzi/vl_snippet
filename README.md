# vl_snippet

**vl_snippet** is django-cms plugin which is part of VL (Viva Library, https://vits.pro/dev/).

This plugin adds snippet (custom html, js code or prepared template) to page.


## Installation

vl_snippet requires vl_core package: https://github.com/vivazzi/vl_core

There is no vl_snippet in PyPI, so you can install this package from repository only.

$ pip install git+https://github.com/vivazzi/vl_snippet
```


## Configuration 

1. Add `vl_snippet` to `INSTALLED_APPS` after `vl_core`:

    'vl_core',
    'vl_snippet',
    ...
)
```

2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the vl_snippet models.
